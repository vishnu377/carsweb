            <!-- INTRODUCTION (Aapka Personal Touch) -->
            <div class="personal-note">
                "Just the other day, I was out on a drive with my best friend. As we cruised through the city, a thought struck me—remember how popular the Tata Sierra was back in the 90s? I asked my friend if he still liked that car, and his face lit up. 'I loved it!' he said. It’s amazing to see how Tata Motors is taking those golden memories and powering them with the clean energy of the future."
            </div>

            <p>Today, Tata Motors dominates the EV space in India, and the <strong>Tata Sierra EV 2026</strong> is the perfect example of how the brand is connecting nostalgia with high-tech electric power. It’s not just a car; it’s an emotion for millions of Indians.</p>

            <!-- SECTION 2: EXTERIOR -->
            <h2>The 'Sierra Silhouette': Why It Looks Different</h2>
            <p>During our conversation, my friend pointed out something very interesting—the Sierra EV looks nothing like your typical SUV. And that’s exactly what Tata wanted. While other brands are making generic designs, Tata brought back the iconic <strong>Alpine Windows</strong>.</p>
            
            <p>Why will people love these massive rear windows? Because they make the cabin feel incredibly airy and offer a view that no other SUV can. With its muscular, 'mardana' stance and futuristic LED light bars, this car is going to turn heads every time it stops at a traffic signal. It’s a bold mix of retro charm and modern-day aggression.</p>

            <!-- SECTION 3: INTERIOR -->
            <h2>Is Three a Crowd? The Triple-Screen Interior</h2>
            <p>Moving inside, we noticed the massive tech upgrade. Nowadays, everyone loves screens, but <strong>is a triple-screen setup too much?</strong> Not really. While the driver gets the essential data, the co-passenger gets a dedicated screen for entertainment and navigation—no more fighting over the music!</p>
            
            <p>The luxury feel inside the Sierra EV is top-notch. From the premium materials to the ambient lighting, the cabin feels like a high-end lounge. It’s a massive step up for Tata, making you feel like you’re sitting in an SUV that costs twice its price.</p>

            <!-- SECTION 4: RANGE & SPECS -->
            <h2>End of Range Anxiety: 500 KM on a Single Charge?</h2>
            <p>One question that every EV buyer asks: <em>"Is a 500km range enough for long highway trips?"</em> My friend and I discussed this, and the answer is a resounding yes. With Tata’s rapidly growing fast-charging network, long-distance travel is no longer a headache.</p>

            <div class="spec-box my-4">
                <h5 class="fw-bold mb-3 text-danger">Tech Highlights:</h5>
                <ul class="mb-0">
                    <li><strong>Estimated Range:</strong> 500+ KM per charge.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fast Charging:</strong> Trustworthy Tata tech (10-80% in ~45 mins).</li>
                    <li><strong>Safety:</strong> Targetting a 5-Star Bharat NCAP rating.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <!-- SECTION 5: PRICE & VALUE -->
            <h2>Price vs. Value: Who Should Buy It?</h2>
            <p>With an expected price between <strong>₹18 Lakh and ₹25 Lakh</strong>, the big question is—is it worth it? For the middle-class family looking for one car that does it all, or for the luxury lover who wants something unique, the Sierra EV offers a compelling package. When you consider the savings on fuel and the premium experience, it truly feels like "Value for Money."</p>

            <!-- SECTION 6: THE 'DESI DEFENDER' VERDICT -->
            <h2>My Personal Take: The 'Desi Defender'?</h2>
            <p>To be honest, if you ask me, my friend said it best: <em>"No matter what people say, I love this car from the heart."</em> Everything about it feels right. Some people are even calling it the **'Desi Defender'** because of its boxy, rugged look. Whether you love it for the nostalgia or the tech, the Sierra EV is a winner.</p>
