            <!-- THE EMOTIONAL STORY (Human Touch) -->
            <div class="personal-note shadow-sm">
                "I remember the day my younger brother got his first salary. He didn't want a huge SUV that was hard to park, nor did he want a simple hatchback. He wanted something that felt like an 'Achievement.' We spent days visiting showrooms, but when we walked into NEXA and saw the <strong>Fronx</strong> under the spotlights, he just stopped. 
                <br><br>
                As we drove it home that night, the connected LED lights at the back looked like a victory lap. For a middle-class Indian boy, a car is not just a way to travel; it's a promise kept to his parents. The Fronx, with its sleek crossover looks and premium feel, gave him exactly that—the feeling that he had finally 'arrived.' This car doesn't just run on petrol; it runs on the dreams of young India."
            </div>

            <p>Welcome to 2026. In a market flooded with SUVs, the <strong>Maruti Suzuki Fronx</strong> has carved its own niche. It’s the perfect blend of a sophisticated hatchback and a rugged SUV. It’s for those who want style without the bulk.</p>

            <h2>1. Design: The Crossover Masterclass</h2>
            <p>The first thing that hits you about the 2026 Fronx is its stance. It looks expensive. The front grille, inspired by the Grand Vitara, gives it a 'don't-mess-with-me' attitude. But as you move to the side, the sloping roofline (Coupe style) reminds you of high-end luxury crossovers. The rear is perhaps the most beautiful part of the car—the <strong>Connected LED Light Bar</strong> glows with a premium intensity that makes it stand out even in the heaviest rain or fog.</p>

            <h2>2. The "Boosterjet" Punch: Driving Pleasure</h2>
            <p>If you think Maruti cars are only about mileage, the <strong>1.0L Turbo Boosterjet</strong> engine will prove you wrong. When you hit the pedal, the car responds with a 'josh' that puts a smile on your face. In the 2026 version, Maruti has further refined the suspension. It now feels more planted at high speeds, and the body roll is almost negligible compared to taller SUVs like the Brezza.</p>

            </div>

            <h2>3. Interior: The NEXA Experience</h2>
            <p>Inside, the Fronx feels like a lounge. The burgundy and black dual-tone theme is classy. The 2026 model features a more responsive <strong>Head-Up Display (HUD)</strong>, which makes you feel like a pilot, keeping your eyes on the road while seeing your speed and navigation. The 360-degree camera is a lifesaver in tight parking spots. Whether it's the wireless Android Auto or the Arkamys sound system, everything inside screams 'Premium.'</p>

            <h2>4. Mileage: The "Average" King</h2>
            <p>We Indians love our mileage, and Maruti knows it. The new 2026 Hybrid system is a game-changer. 
            <br>
            <span class="mileage-highlight">Real-World Mileage: 22-25 kmpl (Highway) | 19-21 kmpl (City)</span>
            <br>
            Even with the Turbo engine, the Fronx doesn't pinch your pocket. It’s the only car that gives you the thrill of a turbocharger with the peace of mind of a Maruti service network.</p>

            <!-- COMPARISON SECTION -->
            <h2>5. Fronx vs Rivals: Who Wins?</h2>
            <div class="comparison-card shadow-sm">
                <p class="mb-1"><strong>Fronx vs Tata Nexon:</strong> The Nexon is more rugged, but the Fronx is much smoother, more refined, and offers better fuel efficiency and a more premium cabin feel.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="comparison-card shadow-sm">
                <p class="mb-1"><strong>Fronx vs Toyota Taisor:</strong> While they are siblings, the Fronx benefits from Maruti’s wider service reach and slightly better resale value in the long run.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>6. Safety: Protecting the Family</h2>
            <p>Safety has become a priority for Maruti. The 2026 Fronx comes equipped with 6 airbags, Electronic Stability Program (ESP), and Hill Hold Assist. The build quality feels more "solid" than earlier Maruti hatchbacks. Knowing that your car has a 360-degree view and multiple safety nets gives you the confidence to take your family on long highway drives.</p>

It is not just a machine; it is a statement of style and smartness. It is the crossover that India didn't know it needed, but now cannot live without. </p>
