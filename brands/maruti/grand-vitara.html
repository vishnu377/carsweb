            <!-- THE EMOTIONAL STORY (Human Touch) -->
            <div class="personal-note shadow-sm">
                "I remember my father checking the fuel gauge every 50 kilometers during our old summer road trips. He loved driving, but the rising cost of petrol was always a silent worry behind his smile. 
                <br><br>
                Last month, I took him for a long drive in the <strong>Grand Vitara Strong Hybrid</strong>. We drove from the city to the hills, almost 400 kilometers away. When we reached, the fuel needle had barely moved. My father looked at the silent instrument cluster and said, 'Beta, this isn't just a car; it's peace of mind.' Seeing him enjoy the drive without worrying about the next petrol pump made me realize that Maruti has finally built a car that understands the heart and the wallet of the Indian middle class."
            </div>

            <p>Welcome to 2026. The <strong>Maruti Suzuki Grand Vitara</strong> has completely changed the perception of what a Maruti car can be. It is no longer just about 'affordable hatchbacks.' It is now a symbol of sophisticated technology, premium luxury, and unmatched efficiency.</p>

            <h2>1. The Hybrid Revolution: Engineering at its Best</h2>
            <div class="hybrid-badge">Self-Charging Intelligent Hybrid Tech</div>
            <p>The biggest talking point of the 2026 Grand Vitara is its <strong>Strong Hybrid</strong> system. Unlike traditional cars, it starts in absolute silence on Electric Vehicle (EV) mode. In stop-and-go city traffic, the engine remains off most of the time, saving you thousands of rupees every month. It’s like having an electric car that you never need to plug in—it charges its own battery while you drive.</p>
            <p>When you need more power on the highway, the 1.5L TNGA petrol engine kicks in seamlessly. The transition is so smooth that you won't even realize it unless you look at the energy flow diagram on the screen. It’s a masterclass in modern engineering.</p>

            <h2>2. Design: A Classy Road Presence</h2>
            <p>The 2026 Grand Vitara doesn't scream for attention; it commands it with grace. The NEXWave grille with rich chrome finish and the 3-element LED DRLs give it a distinctive look that sets it apart from the crowd. It looks tall, butch, and premium. Whether you are arriving at a high-end corporate office or a family wedding, the Grand Vitara ensures you arrive in style.</p>

            <h2>3. Interior: The NEXA Experience</h2>
            <p>Inside, the cabin is wrapped in rich faux leather with champagne gold accents. The fit and finish are the best we have ever seen in a Maruti. But the real star is the <strong>Panoramic Sunroof</strong>. When you open it, the entire cabin feels airy and connected to the world outside. The ventilated seats are a literal lifesaver in the Indian summer, ensuring you stay cool even on long highway runs.</p>

            <h2>4. AllGrip AWD: For the Adventurous Soul</h2>
            <p>For those who love to take the road less traveled, Maruti offers the <strong>AllGrip AWD</strong> system. While it's not a hardcore off-roader like the Jimny, it provides incredible grip on slippery roads, snowy mountain paths, and muddy trails. It gives you the confidence to explore India beyond the paved highways.</p>

            <!-- COMPARISON SECTION -->
            <h2>5. Grand Vitara vs The Competition</h2>
            <div class="comparison-card shadow-sm">
                <p class="mb-1"><strong>Grand Vitara vs Hyundai Creta:</strong> The Creta offers a bit more flashy tech, but the Grand Vitara completely wins on mileage and a much smoother Hybrid driving experience.</p>

                <p class="mb-1"><strong>Grand Vitara vs Toyota Hyryder:</strong> Since they are cousins, the choice comes down to personal design preference and the trust you have in Maruti’s massive service network.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>6. Safety: Protection for Your Loved Ones</h2>
            <p>Safety has moved to the center stage for Maruti. The 2026 Grand Vitara comes with 6 Airbags, Tyre Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS), and Electronic Stability Program (ESP). The 360-degree camera makes parking this large SUV in tight city spots a child's play. It feels solid, planted, and safe at triple-digit speeds on the expressway.</p>
