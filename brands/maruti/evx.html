            <!-- INTRODUCTION (Personal Feelings) -->
            <div class="personal-note">
                "I remember my Dad's first car was a Maruti 800. For years, we only trusted Maruti because 'service everywhere' was a reality, not just a slogan. This morning, as I looked at the new eVX, I felt a strange sense of nostalgia mixed with excitement. Is Maruti finally ready to conquer the electric world with the same trust? My heart says yes, because for an Indian, Maruti isn't just a car brand—it’s a family member."
            </div>

            <p>It’s January 2026, and the wait is finally over. The <strong>Maruti Suzuki eVX</strong> has landed. While other brands were busy launching multiple EVs, Maruti took its time. They wanted to make sure that when a middle-class Indian family switches to electric, they don't have to compromise on anything.</p>

            <!-- SECTION 2: DESIGN & STANCE -->
            <h2>The "New Face" of Maruti: Bold & Muscular</h2>
            <p>When you first see the eVX, you'll forget everything you know about Maruti's design language. It’s not a small hatchback trying to look big; it’s a <strong>proper SUV</strong>. It has a high bonnet, a muscular stance, and a futuristic closed-off grille that tells the world, "I am electric, but I am tough."</p>
            
            <p>During my walkaround, I noticed the large wheels and the high ground clearance. It looks like it can handle the worst of our city potholes and the unpaved roads of our villages with ease. It’s a design that commands respect at a traffic light.</p>

            <!-- SECTION 3: THE RANGE FACTOR -->
            <h2>The New "Kitna Deti Hai": 550 KM Range?</h2>
            <p>The first question my uncle asked me when he heard about the eVX was, <em>"Bhai, ek baar charge karne pe kitna chalegi?"</em> (How far will it go on one charge?). In 2026, Maruti has answered this with a massive **60kWh battery** pack that promises a range of around 500-550 km.</p>

            <!-- SECTION 4: INTERIOR & TECH -->
            <h2>A Maruti Cabin Like Never Before</h2>
            <p>Step inside, and the eVX will shock you. Gone are the days of basic dashboards. The 2026 eVX features a **dual-screen setup** that looks like it belongs in a luxury car. The materials feel soft, the seats are incredibly supportive, and there is a sense of "premium-ness" that we've only seen in Nexa cars so far.</p>
            
            <p>And the best part? It’s practical. There are plenty of storage spaces for your water bottles, phones, and snacks for those long family road trips. It feels like Maruti has listened to every Indian mother’s demand for a "spacious and useful" car.</p>

            <!-- SECTION 5: THE TRUST FACTOR -->
            <h2>Why Buy the eVX over Tata or Hyundai?</h2>
            <p>Let's be real. Tata and Hyundai already have great EVs. So why wait for Maruti? My answer is simple: <strong>Peace of Mind</strong>. Knowing that even if I take my EV to a remote town in Himachal or a small village in Kerala, I will find a Maruti technician who knows how to help. That network is Maruti's biggest strength, and in 2026, that's what will make the eVX a bestseller.</p>

            <!-- SECTION 6: VERDICT -->
            <h2>Final Verdict: The People's EV</h2>
            <p>If you've been waiting to buy an EV but were scared about reliability and service, the eVX is for you. It’s an emotional milestone for Maruti Suzuki. It shows that they can be futuristic without losing their "Desi" roots. </p>
            
            <p>The expected price of <strong>₹18 Lakh to ₹24 Lakh</strong> puts it right in the heart of the competition. But with Maruti's badge on the front, it’s not just an EV; it’s a promise. If you ask me, the "King of Indian Roads" is back, and this time, he’s silent but powerful.</p>
