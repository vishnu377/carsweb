            <!-- THE EMOTIONAL STORY (Human Touch) -->
            <div class="personal-note shadow-sm">
                "I grew up in a busy Indian city where the sound of engines and the smell of exhaust fumes were just part of daily life. But last year, when I held my newborn daughter in my arms for the first time, I looked out of the window at the heavy smog and felt a sudden pang of worry. What kind of world are we leaving for them? 
                <br><br>
                Standing in front of the <strong>Mahindra BE 6e</strong>, I didn't just see a car made of steel and silicon. I saw a promise. I saw a silent, clean future where our children can breathe freely. Driving an EV like the BE 6e isn't just about the 'Triple Screen' or the 0-100 speed; it's about the silence of a cleaner tomorrow. For the first time, an Indian SUV made me feel that we are finally ready to lead the world towards a better planet."
            </div>

            <p>The <strong>Mahindra BE 6e</strong> is a landmark moment for the Indian automotive industry. Built on the revolutionary <strong>INGLO</strong> platform, it represents Mahindra’s 'Born Electric' vision—a car that wasn't adapted from petrol, but born to be electric.</p>

            <h2>1. Design: The Sci-Fi Reality</h2>
            <p>The BE 6e looks like it just drove off the set of a Hollywood sci-fi movie. Its sharp, aerodynamic silhouette is designed to cut through the air with minimal resistance, which is crucial for maximizing battery range. The massive <strong>C-shaped LED DRLs</strong> and the sculpted hood give it an aggressive stance that turns heads everywhere it goes. It doesn't just look new; it looks 'Next-Gen.'</p>

            <h2>2. The Cockpit: A Digital Revolution</h2>
            <p>If the exterior is impressive, the interior is mind-blowing. The highlight is the <strong>Triple Screen Setup</strong>. While most cars are struggling to offer one good screen, Mahindra has provided a panoramic digital experience that covers the entire dashboard. The gear shifter looks like a fighter jet's joystick, and the center console wraps around the driver, making you feel like the pilot of a high-tech machine.</p>

                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-md-6">
                        <ul class="list-unstyled">

                </div>
            </div>

            <h2>3. Performance: The INGLO Edge</h2>
            <p>Being 'Born Electric' means the weight distribution is perfect. The batteries are placed low in the floor, giving the BE 6e a very low center of gravity. This translates to amazing stability in corners—something traditional SUVs struggle with. The instant torque from the electric motor means you can overtake anything on the highway with just a small tap on the pedal.</p>

            <h2>4. Charging: Faster Than a Coffee Break</h2>
            <p>Range anxiety is a thing of the past with the BE 6e. It supports ultra-fast DC charging. If you find a compatible 175kW charger, you can get from 5% to 80% battery in less than 30 minutes. This makes the BE 6e a viable car even for long inter-city road trips across India.</p>
